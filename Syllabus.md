# CSCI-4622-Machine-Learning-18fa

Course Description
Machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that learn from experience. 
Machine learning systems have been developed and used in a wide range of settings, ranging from spam detection, to medical diagonosis, 
to recommendation systems that adapts to and even defines our preferences, to autonomous vehicles that learn to drive. 
There have also been important advances in the theory and algorithms that form the foundation of this field. 
This course will provide a broad introduction to the field of machine learning.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to take a problem and analyze it to determine 
which machine learning techniques are appropriate for solving the problem, how to prepare data to use that solution, 
apply the solution, and to evaluate the results. 
For the most common machine learning techniques, you’ll also be able to implement solutions in Python.

It is required that you have regular access to a computer and an Internet connection throughout this course. A laptop is preferable.

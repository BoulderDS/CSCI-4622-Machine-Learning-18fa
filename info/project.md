# CSCI 4622 (Fall 2018): Final project

The final project offers you an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques on a problem that you *care* about beyond the scope of homeworks. It also helps you practice a diverse set of skills, including working in a team and providing constructive feedback.


## Timeline

* Group formation due: Oct 12
* Final project proposal due: Oct 26
* Hackathon week: Nov 26 --- Nov 30
* Final project presentation: Dec 12
* Final project report due: Dec 14

## Groups

You must form a group of 2-3 students enrolled in this course and make a post on Piazza with your names (use `finalproject` to tag the post) by 11:59pm on Oct 12. 

## Project brainstorming

We will use Piazza and office hours **heavily** to discuss final project ideas. Please use `#projectideas` to tag corresponding posts on Piazza. Course staff will offer feedback to these posts.

A good project should    

* be an interesting well-motivated problem;
* have readily available data, or a clear plan to gather the dataset by Oct 31 (the dataset should be ready five days after the proposal);
* can be formulated or partially addressed with machine learning techniques;
* have a solution (ideally multiple solutions) that you can implement within the scope of this class.

Kaggle competitions can usually satisfy these constaints.



## Final project proposal

Each group will submit a proposal of at most two pages by 11:59pm on Oct 26 on Piazza. A good proposal should

* explain why the project is worth studying;
* explain why machine learning techniques are appropriate;
* demonstrate that you (will) have access to datasets;
* present initial thoughts of possible approaches.


## Hackathon week

This is a week for you to focus on the project. The instructors will go around the classroom and help you with your project.

Although I do not take attendence in any lecture, you are required to attend hackathon to get the participant points in the project.


## Final presentation

The final presentation will be on December 12.  In the final presentation you will present your project in 5 minutes.
You need to 

* Explain what you did and what you think is the most exciting thing from this project

* What challenges you had

* Review how well you did

## Final report

The final report is due on Dec 14 on Moodle. List group members in the report and sort the name alphabetically. You report should explain what
you did and what results you achieved.  This document should
make it clear:

* Why this project is a good (or bad) idea,
* What you did,
* Whether your technique worked or not,
* Who did what.


Please do not go over 2500 words unless you have a really good reason.
Images are a much better use of space than words, usually (there's no
limit on including images, but use judgement and be selective).

We are encouraged to use the NIPS format. You can download the LaTex template [here](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). We strongly recommend using LaTex, but you can use this [Microsoft word template](http://web.archive.org/web/20130424174118/http://media.nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Styles/nips2013.docx) from 2013.
**All submissions must be in PDF format.**

The final report will be evaluated based on the following aspects:

* Writeup: Does the writeup explain what you did in a way that is clear and effective?

* Technical Soundness: Did you use the appropriate tools for the problem? Were they relevant to this class?

* Effort: The amount of effort that you spend in the process.

* Performance: How did your techniques perform?

Tips to get your report better:

* Provide an error analysis.  An error analysis must contain examples from the
  development set that you get wrong.  You should show those examples
  and explain why (in terms of features or the model) they have the
  wrong answer.  You should have been doing this all along as your
  derive new approaches, but this is your final inspection of
  your errors. The feature or model problems you discover should not
  be trivial features you could add easily.  Instead, these should be
  features or models that are difficult to correct.  An error analysis
  is not the same thing as simply presenting the error matrix, as it
  does not inspect any individual examples.

* Explain the motivation for your approaches.  For example, features shouldn't come out of nowhere; you should have a clear domain-specific story for how you derived the features or an error analysis motivations for the features you create.


## Grade

The grade will be as follows:

* Proposal: 4 points,
* Hackathon week participation: 4 points,
* Final presentation: 4 points,
* Final report: 12 points,

in total, 24 points.
